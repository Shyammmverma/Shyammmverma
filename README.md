# Hi there! I'm [Shyammmverma] ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a student learning to code and exploring different areas in tech! Right now, 
I'm focused on building projects in [Web Development/Data Science/etc.] and expanding my skills in languages like Python, JavaScript and SQL. I love collaborating with others, whether it's a class project or a personal side project.

Feel free to check out my repositories â€“ theyâ€™re a work in progress, but Iâ€™m proud of what I've learned along the way. 
Always open to feedback or collaboration, so reach out if you're interested!

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
